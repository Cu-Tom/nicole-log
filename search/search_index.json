Lesson Summary (February 23, lesson20) In the course, I completed the installation of Rhino 3D modeling software, and learned operations such as view switching, basic model creation and editing. After the lesson, I organized the recent learning content into a review document, which is convenient for daily review and consolidation. From next week onwards, I will gradually go deeper into complex modeling techniques, and I will review the content in the document more often in my spare time.","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginfeb23/#welcome-to-nicoles-lab","text":"","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginfeb23/#lesson-summary-february-23-lesson20","text":"In the course, I completed the installation of Rhino 3D modeling software, and learned operations such as view switching, basic model creation and editing.

Lesson Summary (March 2, lesson21) In this lesson, we learned the basic concepts of 3D printing, including its principles, developmental origins, and application scenarios, and the teacher helped us build a comprehensive understanding of 3D printing technology. Then, we learned how to use 3D printing slicing software and explored publicly available 3D modeling websites to understand how to obtain and prepare models for printing. In the end, I successfully printed my favorite 3D model and experienced the complete process from digital model to physical object!","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginmar2/#welcome-to-nicoles-lab","text":"","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginmar2/#lesson-summary-march-2-lesson21","text":"In this lesson, we learned the basic concepts of 3D printing, including its principles, developmental origins, and application scenarios, and the teacher helped us build a comprehensive understanding of 3D printing technology.
