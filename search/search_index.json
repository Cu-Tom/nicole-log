Lesson Summary (February 23, lesson20) In the course, I completed the installation of Rhino 3D modeling software, and learned operations such as view switching, basic model creation and editing. After the lesson, I organized the recent learning content into a review document, which is convenient for daily review and consolidation. From next week onwards, I will gradually go deeper into complex modeling techniques, and I will review the content in the document more often in my spare time.","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginfeb23/#welcome-to-nicoles-lab","text":"","title":"Welcome to Nicole's Lab!"},{"location":"loginfeb23/#lesson-summary-february-23-lesson20","text":"In the course, I completed the installation of Rhino 3D modeling software, and learned operations such as view switching, basic model creation and editing.
